# Cancer_Detection_Histology_images
Given a Query Image, check cancer regions using SVM and neural networks. Divide the histology image into multiple tiles and Apply a bounding box on it to detect regions of Query image.

For Example: Given Mitosis as a Query Image, divide a histology image into 20 tiles. Check on each tile whether it's a Mitosis image. If yes, bound it with green border.
