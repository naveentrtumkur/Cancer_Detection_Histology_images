######## The main functionality is to tile a svs image into smaller pieces #################
# 1. The division will happend based on the size of the full size image.
# 2. The divided images would be sequentially stored in an output directory (Name would hold a counter
# that would be incremented sequentially left -> right)
# 3. Later Perform classification on these individual images and return the
# full vector of classication, a vector of segemnted images (only their location would be useful).
